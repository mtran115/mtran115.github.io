        <aside>
          The name of the identifier property. If specified, the returned result will be a list of the items' identifiers, otherwise it will be a list of the items

        <input type="number" id="locationRange" min="0" max="100" value="0">
        <aside>
          Determines approximately where in the text is the pattern expected to be found

        <aside>
          At what point does the match algorithm give up. A threshold of 0.0 requires a perfect match (of both letters and location), a threshold of 1.0 would match anything

        <aside>
          Determines how close the match must be to the fuzzy location (specified by location). An exact letter match which is distance characters away from the fuzzy location would score as a complete mismatch. A distance of 0 requires the match be at the exact location specified, a threshold of 1000 would require a perfect match to be within 800 characters of the location to be found using a threshold of 0.8.

        <aside>
          The maximum length of the pattern. The longer the pattern, the more intensive the search operation will be. Whenever the pattern exceeds the maxPatternLength, an error will be thrown. Why is this important? Read this.
